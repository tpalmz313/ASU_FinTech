# PAXOS

## How Paxos Came to Be

* Paxos is the first regulated blockain infrastructure platfrom, providing confidence of a bank (with their trust), and the innovation of silicon valley (half their company is product and engineering). Its products set the foundation for a new and open financial systme that can operate faster and more effeiciently. Currently trillions of dollars are locked in outdated and inefficient financial infrastructure that is closed off and inaccessible to millions of people. Paxos is developing a new and improved systme that will allow assets to move anywhere in the world at any time, in a secure way instantly. Paxos is a privately held company that is owned by its founders.

When was the company incorporated?
 * incorporated as a Trust Co LC established in 2015 in New York State

Who are the founders of the company?
    
 * Charles Cascarilla and Rich Teo founded Paxos in 2012

How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

 * The idea of Paxos came about when CEO and Co-founder Charles Cascarilla started his own asset manager Cedar Hill Capital. Here Charles and Rich were heavily invested in internatonal exchanges, technology providers and financial institutions. Charles and Rich had a very close up and personal view of the countless financial systemic failures that were brought about by the 2008 global financial crisis realizing how the clearing and settlement infrastructure  which underpins the stock market played into this crisis. On the backend of the devistating time Charles had leaned of Bitcoin and had read the foundational white paper when its value was roughly 4 cents, this is where Charles interest and curiousity in blockchain technology and how it could transform the financial indusrty started. In 2012, Charles, Rich, and Emil started Paxos launching their first product, the itBit exchange (the first institutional bitcoin exchange) which was based in Singapore. 

How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

* Paxos has depended on on private venture capital funding for its financial backing for operations and expansion. Paxos funding starts all the way back in 2013 where Canaan Partners, RRE Ventures invested 3.3 million for start up and operations, followed by a 28.2 million invested May of 2015 (Series A), then a 65 million (series B) in May of 2018. December 2020 (Series C) Paxos secured 142 million from Declaration PArtners, . followed by its biggest (series D) at 300 million from Oak HC/FT consisting of previous investors Decloration Partners, PayPal Ventures, Mithril Capital, Senator investment group, Liberty City Ventures, WestCap and others. a Corporate Round is in the works but hasnt been finalized making their total funding ~ $538.5 million. 
    
## Business Activities:

What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Charles Cascarilla thinks that it's very vaulable to change how the UI works and the having a shared plaform for your financial life. To dive deeper Paxos recognized that the infrastructure was being neglected. It was archaic and outdated, and Paxos believes that in orer to make a profound shift in the the modern day financial system foucsing on the infrastructure layer needed to be their priority. You may ask why? Well their goal is to upgrade this infrastructure so they can enable a different financial system. This would entail changing the fundamental attributes of those assets by putting them into a new technological platform, in this case blockchain technology. 
    
Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Financial institutions customers in general want to have a better way to be able to move assets. Therefore anyone who uses financial services is an intended customer. There are no competitors since Paxos' focus is on the infrastructure layer for enterprise firms, for payment companies, for broker dealers, banks, for FinTech firms. No one has dedicated themselves to solving this putting Paxos in a very unique position. 
     
     * PayPal, Venmo, Bank of America, Facebook are all customers who utilize Paxos infrastructure 
     
     * use case example for Facebook, 3 billion people to potentially use their products. In this case they created a regulated dollar token, and facebook launched their remitance service between the us and guatamala using paxos. giving the opportunity for unbanked and underbanked poeple the ability to send money for zero cost.
     
     * venmo and paypal use case: They came to paxos wanting to make crypto available to their customers, chose paxos for their holding and buying and selling of crypto becaue of their regulation and infrastructure to provide this service at the scale of these companies

Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
 
* the blockchain is a database or storage infrastructure for data that is secured by both encryption and by being decentralized. Now you may have heard of enterprise blockchain which is the trending caviot of this domain. Enterprise blockchain means private blockchain or permissioned blockchain. Now here is the difference, unlike flagship use case I.e. cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, these "private" blockchains fall under the control of a centralized "owner" generally the company that has deployed the chain. Many people dont understand the technology behind blockchain and how its use cases expand very far, from pharmaceuticals to finance to diamond mining. Investments in blockain technology by businesses is forecasted to reach almost 16 billion by 2023. For comparison spending in 2019 was 2.7 billion. 
    
What are the other major companies in this domain?
    
* Paxos is a unicorn company where they really do take the cake in this domain for what they're implementing into the finance world. However, there are other companies with similiar goals and ambitions such as Oyoba Inc., Crypto Finance AG, Gatecoin, Chain.com and many others. They all share the goal of users gaiing full control of their finances and having their financial systems on the blockain.

## Recommendations

If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    
* This would benefit the company because it would show the general public and investors that Paxos isn't just another money hungry corporation and that they do provide quality products and enable their customers to take advantage of them. 

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
